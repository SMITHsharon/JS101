### Project Specs
#### `JavaScript` basics
Various `JavaScript` coding syntax and constructs were demonstrated and discussed, including:
- declaring variables and assigning values
- performing calculations using both variables and constants
- simple string methods
- simple array methods
- chaining methods
- `switch` statement
- object arrays (`key: value` pairs; declaring / accessing values / assigning values)
- writing simple functions
- writing output to the DOM
- writing output to `console.log()`

The various `JavaScript` files underwent many changes throughout the class discussion, with additions and deletions. Part of the discussion was lost from the final "save". 


### Technologies Used
- `html`
- `JavaScript`


### How To View The Screen 
#### (Node must be installed on your machine):
```
git clone https://github.com/SMITHsharon/JS101.git
cd JS101
npm install http-server -g
http-server -p 8080
```

This will show in your browser at: `http://localhost:8080`
You must open the Developer Console to view the `JavaScript` output (`console.log()`s).
