Various `JavaScript` coding syntax and constructs were demonstrated and discussed, including:
- declaring variables and assigning values
- performing calculations using both variables and constants
- simple string methods
- array methods
- chaining methods
- `switch` statement
- object arrays (`key: value` pairs)
- writing simple functions
- writing to the DOM

The various `JavaScript` files changed in various ways throughout class.
